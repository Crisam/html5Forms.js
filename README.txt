HTML5Widgets is a JavaScript polyfill that implements a subset of the HTML5
Forms module in all browsers.  The script will only add support for the
different parts of the module when there doesn't exist a native
implementation - for example, at the time of this writing, it will implement
the datetime calendar widget in all browser except Opera, which supports it
natively.
